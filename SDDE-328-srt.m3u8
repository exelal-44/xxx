00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:50.383

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.510
Also, please prepare a little hot water.

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:40.117
It was cool

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:44.688
oh, and then

00:48:46.323 --> 00:48:48.892
Regarding the addition of drinks

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:52.462
Since you are a customer,

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:58.735
Please, no matter what, I will ask the room attendant to leave the sea.

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:03.640
Oh yeah, a little less alcohol, a little more juice

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:08.879

00:49:09.212 --> 00:49:11.982
There is one oolong tea, but it's only one

00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:16.553
That's about 2 of each kind.

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:21.091
oh over there

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:28.732
And as we continue to talk, I'm talking about tomorrow's breakfast on the 1st.

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:34.938

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:39.443
I will prepare roughly

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:42.779
What time would you like to start

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:47.985
It's around 8 o'clock. It's formal since 8 o'clock.

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:52.222
Since the checkered flag is at 10:00,

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:57.794
I hope that you will be able to finish your meal in moderation.

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:04.368
In some way, are you going sightseeing in either place?

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:08.405
Do you have any good recommendations for the proprietress?

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:12.175

00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:14.511

00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:22.986
Um, something in particular

00:50:23.887 --> 00:50:29.026
Your request is the amusement park type, animals and plants

00:50:29.726 --> 00:50:31.795
Main volcano

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.766
Shinjuku with something like a botanical garden

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:39.403
If so, walk from here

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:42.205
That's right, at the 29-inch

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:47.644
There is a forest botanical garden, so how about that?

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:51.882
For everyone to take a walk, then

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:55.052
There is also a small amusement facility,

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:58.622
You can also play golf on the soil

00:50:59.022 --> 00:50:59.890
this is pretty

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:04.528

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:21.111
Please start selling

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:24.414
It's not a discount, but for everyone below

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:28.919
I think it will help you pay for various drinks.

00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:30.687
I understand

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:35.625
If you don't have any other questions

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:39.496
I would like to show you the facilities in the hotel.

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:44.901

It is 6,000 yen for 45 minutes.

00:52:07.824 --> 00:52:10.527
me then

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:16.633
There is also a small bath room, but the large communal bath

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:20.070
24 hours for groups

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:26.076
It's a business section; there are towels in the dressing room,

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:30.547
Then Debuster, Full Dryer, etc.

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:33.183
We have prepared, so from your room

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:39.289

You can come and go freely, so please wear your favorite clothes and pull your hair back.

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:49.499

00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:06.716
How do you feel about this time?

00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:12.489
Oh yeah

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:19.262

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:20.230
home is water

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:23.833
stretch out after the party

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:26.803
If you enjoy karaoke,

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:31.474
It's outside the hotel, but it's also inside the hotel.

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:34.644
There is a temporary storage place, until 2:00 a.m.

00:53:35.278 --> 00:53:39.449
open and yes

00:53:39.449 --> 00:53:42.886
The business hours will be extended depending on the customer's request, so

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.923
There you are free to do whatever you like

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:49.960
you are using

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.296
It's okay if you don't make a reservation there.

00:53:55.532 --> 00:53:58.435
One day, it is a large space,

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:02.539
Because the customer was a head-sized group

00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:07.510
You can come, so my body has entered

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:10.280

It is now a ramen shop

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.489
And it closed a little early.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:24.060
Until midnight

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.396
Orders stop at 11:45

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:31.901
Ah, ah, the master of the meal is not here. Hurry up and go.

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:36.006

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:40.577
Just in case, this is soy sauce ramen

00:54:41.378 --> 00:54:44.247
Recently, I often want to have tonkotsu ramen.

00:54:44.814 --> 00:54:48.351
Inside the detailed house, my husband

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:52.622
I'm running the store. The owner runs.

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:57.127

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:31.728

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:40.303
Excuse me, is that

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:52.849
it's important

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:58.221
It's good yeah

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:03.760
There is a souvenir shop in the hotel,

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:07.230
I'm going today

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:12.235
It's closing time, so I'll be there tomorrow at 107:00.

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:18.475
The sound, etc. is the possibility of receiving a read-aloud mail.

00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:29.486
I have

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:33.022

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:36.760
It's a little hot, maybe because it was a cockroach Yes

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:48.538
It looks like it's going to feel good soon. It's tomorrow's weather.

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:51.674
But if there is, it's spring love day

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:57.113
And when the average temperature reaches about 16 degrees,

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:04.320
He brought me a piece of blissful condensed milk far away

00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:11.694

This is our hotel

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:36.666
In the natural hot spring of the pride of the source

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:41.504
In order for customers to take a bath, please change into your own clothes.

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:45.575

Maybe

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:35.778
It's the end of the New Year Group

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:39.415
Since it is a customer partner, when there is a shortage of manpower

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:44.187

At the encore performance, the presence is not shown on the surface

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:14.387

01:49:11.611 --> 01:49:15.815
last in that sense

01:49:18.618 --> 01:49:29.095

Oh, hey

01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:56.376
I wonder if I should cherish the script, gently buried

01:51:59.779 --> 01:52:05.819
But that person

01:52:12.459 --> 01:52:26.339

One thing that made me want to make you feel good

01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:19.259
It's okay if you think it's a little vulgar

01:53:19.259 --> 01:53:22.796
or she in this song

01:53:27.333 --> 01:53:41.848
Back and feelings

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:46.452

It seems like I'm just explaining or something, but it feels good

01:56:48.334 --> 01:56:54.040
Is that

01:57:04.717 --> 01:57:07.653

02:05:10.669 --> 02:05:22.681

I'll leave it here, so please, ma'am

02:06:40.626 --> 02:06:43.529
Are you alone?

02:06:43.696 --> 02:06:46.098
Let's all go out for a drink

02:06:46.098 --> 02:06:49.201
Oh, that's a lot of karaoke

02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:54.440
It seems like they were having a blast, so are you interested?

02:06:54.807 --> 02:07:00.379
I'm a parent and child at karaoke Ah

02:07:01.013 --> 02:07:03.549
Ladies, if you don't mind,

02:07:04.717 --> 02:07:09.288
Since you're on your own, you'll probably feel lonely at this rate.

02:07:09.288 --> 02:07:12.658
Yes, me and this room attendant

02:07:13.158 --> 02:07:15.894
Until the customer falls asleep

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:20.866
I would like to say that gathering is a comfort, or rather, I would like to serve you.

02:07:20.866 --> 02:07:24.637
But how is it?

02:07:27.606 --> 02:07:29.708
If it's good then that's it

02:07:30.242 --> 02:07:34.380
Is it okay to interrupt anything?

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:39.251
Continue until you feel comfortable

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:41.553
Is that so? If you come

02:07:41.553 --> 02:07:47.426
Well, first of all, if you don't mind, put her on this futon

02:07:48.093 --> 02:07:50.863

02:09:28.193 --> 02:09:30.229
What is it?

02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:33.499

02:11:42.127 --> 02:11:45.097
Do you like being known by the preparation people?

02:11:50.102 --> 02:11:52.070
That's how it feels

02:11:52.804 --> 02:11:55.641
It was a ticking bipedal walk
